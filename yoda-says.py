Your apprentice young Skywalker will be." -- Yoda to Obi-Wan Kenobi\n', '"Lost a planet, Master Obi-Wan has.

Suffering. Death, I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain." -- Yoda\n', '"Around the survivors, a perimeter create!" -- Yoda\n', '"Powerful you have become, Dooku.

Begun, the Clone War has!" -- Yoda\n', '"Much to learn, you still have." -- Yoda to Dooku\n', '"Like fire across the galaxy, the Clone Wars spread. In league with the wicked Count Dooku more and more planets slip. Upon the Jedi Knights falls the duty to lead the newly formed Army of the Republic." -- Yoda\n', '"Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is." -- Yoda\n', '"Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side." -- Yoda to Anakin Skywalker\n', '"Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose." -- Yoda to Anakin Skywalker\n', '"Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have." -- Yoda\n', '"Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers." -- Yoda\n', '"If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be." -- Yoda\n', '"If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find." -- Yoda to Obi-Wan Kenobi\n', '"Destroy the Sith, we must." -- Yoda\n', '"To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not." -- Yoda to Obi-Wan Kenobi\n', '"Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become." -- Yoda to Obi-Wan Kenobi\n', '"The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader." -- Yoda to Obi-Wan Kenobi\n', '"I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away, to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!" -- Yoda\n', 'Yoda: "I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience." Obi-Wan: "He will learn patience." Yoda: "Hmm. Much anger in him, like his father."

A Jedi\'s strength flows from the Force. But beware the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.

A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack." -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?" -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned." -- Yoda to Luke\n', 'Luke: "I don\'t believe it"; Yoda: "That is why you fail." -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try." -- Yoda to Luke , \n', '"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you?" -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"And well you should not! For my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us, and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this, [nudging Luke\'s arm] crude matter! You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere! Even between the land and the ship." -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future, the past, old friends long gone." -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control." -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future." -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered." -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can!" -- Yoda to Luke\n', '"No. There is another." -- Yoda to Obi-Wan\n', '"When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good, you will not, hm?" -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"Strong am I with the Force, but not that strong. Twilight is upon me, and soon night must fall. That is the way of things, the way of the Force." -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need." -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him, that incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you." -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"Remember, a Jedi\'s strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny." -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"Your father he is." -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"Luke, Luke, Do not, Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father\'s fate, you will." -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be." -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"Luke, there is another, Skywalker." -- Yoda to Luke Skywalker\n', '"Pity your new disciple I do; so lately an apprentice, so soon without a Master." -- Yoda\n', '"War does not make one great." -- Yoda\n', '"Proud I am, to stand by Wookiees in their hour of need." -- Yoda\n', '"Yoda I am, fight I will." -- Yoda\n', '"Tired I am, rest I must." -- Yoda\n', '"When all choices seem wrong, choose restraint." -- recalled by Mace Windu\n', '"If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are, a different game you should play." -- recalled by Mace Windu\n', '"A trial of being old is this: remembering which thing one has said into which young ears." -- Yoda\n', 'Yoda: "Think you I have never felt the touch of the dark?

Oh, this is what we let them believe, yes! But when the day comes that even old Yoda does not learn something from his students-then truly, he shall be a teacher no more." -- Yoda\n', '"On many long journeys have I gone. And waited, too, for others to return from journeys of their own. Some return; some are broken; some come back so different only their names remain." -- Yoda\n', '"When you fall, apprentice, catch you I will." -- Yoda to Dooku\n', '"Secret, shall I tell you? Grand Master of Jedi Order am I. Won this job in a raffle I did, think you? "How did you know, how did you know, Master Yoda?" Master Yoda knows these things. His job it is." -- Master Yoda to Scout\n', '"Honor life by living, Padawan. Killing honors only death: only the dark side." -- Yoda\n', '"To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose.
